# Pre-Commit Policy Checklist

**Run through this checklist before EVERY commit**

## Security Checks

## Code Quality
- [ ] Prefer prose and narrative explanations over excessive bullet points
- [ ] README files must include overview, installation, usage, and configuration sections
- [ ] Use clear cross-references with specific section titles or explicit links

## Validation
- [ ] Run `/validate` command
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No policy violations

## Reminder
If any item fails, fix it before committing.
Run `/refresh-policies` if you're unsure about any policy.
