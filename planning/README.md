# Planning Documents

This directory contains planning documents and initial scaffolding scripts used during the project design phase. These files provide historical context for architectural decisions and implementation approaches.

## Contents

### power-nowcasting-implementation-plan.md

The original implementation plan document that outlines the project architecture, technology choices, and development approach. This document served as the blueprint for the actual implementation and contains detailed explanations of:

- Project goals and success criteria
- Data sources and feature engineering approach
- MLflow integration strategy
- Infrastructure requirements and deployment options
- Timeline and milestone definitions

The plan emphasizes reproducible ML workflows with MLflow tracking, GPU-accelerated training on EC2 instances, and portable deployment across environments. Key architectural decisions include using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for better ML ecosystem support and AWS Systems Manager for secure instance access.

### scaffold_power_nowcast.sh

An initial scaffolding script that was considered for project setup but ultimately replaced by a more comprehensive approach. The script generates basic project structure and placeholder code for:

- Data ingestion modules for power and weather data
- Feature engineering with lag and rolling window calculations
- XGBoost baseline model training with MLflow integration
- Basic evaluation and serving components

This script provided a starting point for understanding the project structure but was superseded by the current implementation that includes proper infrastructure as code, documentation standards, and security practices.

## Historical Context

These planning documents reflect the evolution of the project from initial concept to final implementation. Several key changes occurred during development:

**Infrastructure Simplification:** The original plan considered separate development and production environments. The final implementation uses a single shared VPC with configurable instance types to reduce costs for personal use.

**SageMaker Removal:** Initial plans included SageMaker as an optional deployment target. This was removed in favor of a simpler EC2-only approach that provides better cost control and direct GPU access.

**Documentation Standards:** The project adopted formal documentation standards during implementation, leading to more structured and professional documentation than originally envisioned.

**Security Enhancement:** The final implementation includes comprehensive security practices including proper secret management, SSM-based access, and public repository safety measures that were not fully detailed in the initial planning.

## Relationship to Current Implementation

The current project structure differs from the original scaffolding approach in several important ways:

**Infrastructure as Code:** The actual implementation includes comprehensive Terraform modules and Packer templates for reproducible infrastructure deployment, which were not part of the original scaffolding.

**Modular Architecture:** The final Terraform configuration uses reusable modules for VPC, security, compute, and storage components, providing better maintainability than the flat structure originally envisioned.

**Environment Management:** Instead of separate environments, the implementation uses a single shared infrastructure with configurable instance modes for cost optimization.

**Documentation Quality:** The final implementation includes comprehensive documentation following established style guidelines, with separate README files for different components and use cases.

## Usage Notes

These planning documents are preserved for reference but should not be used as current implementation guidance. Refer to the main project README and component-specific documentation for accurate setup and usage instructions.

The scaffolding script in particular should not be executed, as it would create a project structure that conflicts with the current implementation. The script serves as historical reference for understanding the original project concept.

For current development work, follow the setup procedures documented in the main README and the infrastructure deployment guides in the terraform directory.
