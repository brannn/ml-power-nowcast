## Background and Motivation

### Why We Removed LSTM

Our LSTM implementation revealed fundamental mismatches between the model architecture and our use case:

**Technical Issues Identified:**
- **Poor Performance**: LSTM achieved 87.45% MAPE vs. XGBoost's <1% MAPE
- **Negative R²**: -19.64 indicating worse than random predictions
- **Feature Engineering Conflict**: LSTM expects raw sequences, but our data has engineered features (hour_sin, day_of_week_cos, lag features)
- **Prediction Inconsistency**: All time horizons returned identical values (2,795 MW)
- **Scale Mismatch**: Predictions significantly lower than realistic values (~2,800 MW vs. ~29,000 MW)

**Architectural Mismatch:**
- **Tabular vs. Sequential**: Power demand forecasting with engineered features is fundamentally a tabular prediction problem
- **Feature Redundancy**: Our temporal features already capture patterns that LSTM would learn
- **Data Structure**: Engineered features (cyclical encodings, lags) are better suited for tree-based models

**LSTM has been completely removed from the codebase.**

### Performance Testing Results and Model Selection

**TabNet Testing Results (FAILED):**
- **MAPE**: 81.22% vs XGBoost's 3.00% (catastrophically poor)
- **R²**: -23.92 (worse than random predictions)
- **Training time**: 10.5s vs XGBoost's 0.1s (100x slower)
- **Conclusion**: TabNet is fundamentally unsuited for our engineered tabular features

**Why Tree-Based Models Excel:**
- **Engineered features**: Our data has pre-computed cyclical encodings, lag features, and interactions
- **Tabular structure**: Cross-sectional data with temporal features, not sequential time series
- **Feature interactions**: Tree models naturally handle non-linear feature combinations
- **Training efficiency**: Orders of magnitude faster than neural networks
- **Interpretability**: Clear feature importance and decision paths

**Optimal Model Architecture for Power Demand:**
- **Primary**: Tree-based ensemble (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- **Secondary**: Simple dense neural networks for ensemble diversity
- **Avoid**: Complex attention mechanisms, sequence models, over-engineered architectures
